# Odyssey Now Daughter Cards

Replacement daughter card schematics and layouts for the Magnavox Odyssey BLAK version.

## Layout
* `OdysseyDaughterCard<name>` (KiCad 6 project)
  * `footprints/` (non-standard footprint libraries for project)
  * `symbols/` (non-standard symbol libraries for project)
  * `gerbers/` (last generated gerbers for layout)
  * `dimensions.txt` (board dimension in meters for easier ordering from places like AllPCB)
  
## TODO
* Choose an open source hardware license (currently all rights reserved)
* Bill of Materials
* Update title blocks
* Generate pdf's

## Old Designs (legacy)
The original git history for each card (including old prototypes that were made and are likely to be floating around in the VML) be found on the `legacy-*` branches.
